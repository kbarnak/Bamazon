### Bamazon

## Welcome to Bamazon

# Introduction
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that utilizes MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.


## How it works.
Utilizing MySQL populate this database with around 10 different products. 
Make sure that the database utilizes (product_name, department_name, price, stock_quantity).

When you manipulate Bamazon using Node.js you want the user tyo be able to search the product based on ID and have it populate the following: name of product, department product is found in, price, quantity in stock. 

The user should then have the option to purchase the product and have the database update the quantity to show reduced amount based on the amount you baught. Also, the program should be able to calculate you total $ amount based on the purchase you made.
